[{"content":"Introduction In the post, we will talk about mid-journey an AI technology capable to generate images from text.\nMidjourney Mid-journey AI, also known as mid-adoption AI, refers to the point in the development and implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) technology where progress has been made, but the full potential of the technology has not yet been reached. At this stage, organizations and individuals are using AI technology in a limited capacity, and may not have fully realized its potential benefits.\nOne example of mid-journey AI is the (AI image generator, which uses machine learning algorithms to create new images based on a set of inputs. While the technology is able to generate new images, they may not be of the same quality or realism as images created by human designers. Additionally, the technology may not have been fully integrated into the relevant industry or field, and its use may be limited to specific tasks or applications.\nMid-journey AI can also refer to the stage in which an organization or individual has started to implement AI technology, but is still in the process of fully understanding its capabilities and limitations. The organization may not have fully integrated AI into their operations and may still be in the process of testing and evaluating the technology.\nHow to generate images? Currently the only way to generate images is from its discord server (do note that it’s a beta server , changes are constantly being made). Make an account if you haven’t already and join with link provided.\nhttps://discord.com/invite/midjourney\nNow head over to any newcomer rooms Now type the image you want to be generated. For this example, we will create a AI image of Harry potter and the flash’s Barry Allen (with the addition of a 4k image and realistic lighting). The more you specify the better the results, but input the command as shown below.\nLet the bot do its work and your image will be generated in the meanwhile. Each image created will show four variations The images can be either up-scaled or variations can be made again. But in this I will upscale version three. The final Result: Just a head up everyone a limited trial (around 25 queries), and then several options to buy a full membership.\nWrap up There we go, quite the image generated so far\u0026hellip;. but this is just the beginning. Just imagine the possible development that it can achieve such as:\nImproved image quality: AI image generators will continue to improve in terms of image quality, realism, and diversity. This will be achieved by using more advanced deep learning techniques and larger and more diverse training datasets.\nGreater integration with other technologies: AI image generators will increasingly be integrated with other technologies such as virtual and augmented reality, allowing for the creation of more immersive and interactive experiences.\nAutomation and scalability: AI image generators will become more automated and scalable, making them easier to use and accessible to a wider range of users. This will enable more efficient and cost-effective image generation.\nEthical concerns: As AI image generators become more advanced, there will be increasing ethical concerns about their use, particularly when it comes to creating images of people. Efforts will be made to ensure that the technology is used responsibly and in compliance with privacy and data protection regulations.\nCloud-based solutions: More AI image generators will be cloud-based solutions, which will allow for easy access and scalability, and can also help to lower the cost of ownership.\nOverall, the future of mid-journey AI image generators looks promising, with the potential to revolutionise various industries with more realistic and diverse images, greater integration with other technologies, more automation, scalability and ethical concerns.\n","permalink":"https://harshalmandaliya.com/posts/image-ai/","summary":"Introduction In the post, we will talk about mid-journey an AI technology capable to generate images from text.\nMidjourney Mid-journey AI, also known as mid-adoption AI, refers to the point in the development and implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) technology where progress has been made, but the full potential of the technology has not yet been reached.

In this post, I aim to provide a comprehensive account of my involvement in this fascinating project.\nPurpose of the challenge Designed for young people aged between 14 and 21, the annual competition offers a unique opportunity to grapple with real-world challenges. Each year presents a new theme that aligns with current technological advancements. Participants also have the exceptional experience of spending a day immersed in naval life and an overnight stay on board HMS Bristol.\nThe challenge Our task involved an integrated system where two remote-controlled (RC) vehicles a land-based recovery vehicle and a ship-vessel had to collaborate to retrieve a stranded helicopter and return it to safety, all manoeuvred using a single controller.\nProject Execution Over a span of several months, our team designed and constructed the RC vehicles. We were given a list of potential equipment, complete with costs, allowing us to exercise budget control meticulously. After conducting extensive research on the necessary core materials, we moved to the design phase, employing AutoCAD and Solidworks 3D for initial sketches. While we devised multiple designs, each with its own strengths and weaknesses, we eventually settled on a final version.\nAssembly and Testing Upon receiving the materials, we commenced assembly. The vessel was crafted using blue styrofoam to ensure it was both waterproof and lightweight. An acrylic layer added extra buoyancy. Electronic components such as rudder, servo, battery etc, were carefully housed within the vessel\u0026rsquo;s base. Likewise, the car was designed to be compact and lightweight to facilitate its placement on the vessel alongside the \u0026ldquo;downed\u0026rdquo; helicopter.\nPerformance We made two attempts to complete the challenge, one in the morning and another in the afternoon, which afforded us some time to refine our design. Despite our efforts, we were unsuccessful on both counts. Although the vessel operated well in water and the car successfully disembarked to collect the helicopter, we encountered design limitations. The crane hook could only move vertically, lacking the ability to manoeuvre in multiple directions. Additionally, the vessel\u0026rsquo;s propulsion system only allowed for forward motion, making control challenging.\nMuch like the vessel, the car was designed with compactness and lightness in mind, as both it and the \u0026ldquo;downed\u0026rdquo; helicopter needed to share space on the vessel without compromising its stability or operability.\nThere was a total of two attempts to complete the task. One was in the morning, and the other took place in the afternoon (which gave us time to improve and modify the design from the first attempt.\nHowever, we were unsuccessful on both tries. The vessel was successfully moving in the water, and the car was able to leave the vessel and collect the down-bird helicopter. But you must be wondering what the issue was? Well\u0026hellip; the crane hook could only move in a straight motion, either up or down. It could have been better if it had been able to move directions and not locked to a single axis. The other issue was the vessel\u0026rsquo;s trust was a water flush, so it only could move forward, it was difficult to manage (and we managed to control it), but the design could have been tweaked.\nLearning Outcomes The project was a significant learning curve, enriching my experience in multiple facets, from design and assembly to problem-solving and time management. Despite the setbacks, the entire endeavour was immensely enjoyable and instructive, sharpening my skills and deepening my understanding of what it takes to execute a complex project.\n","permalink":"https://harshalmandaliya.com/projects/royal-navy-challenge/","summary":"Introduction In March 2019, a STEM competition held aboard HMS Sultan, centred around the Royal Navy’s integrated systems, that I took part when I was in college.
