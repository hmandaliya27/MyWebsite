# Introduction
In the post, we will talk about mid-journey an AI technology capable to generate images from text.

# Midjourney 
Mid-journey AI, also known as mid-adoption AI, refers to the point in the development and implementation of **artificial intelligence** (AI) technology where progress has been made, but the full potential of the technology has not yet been reached. At this stage, organizations and individuals are using AI technology in a limited capacity, and may not have fully realized its potential benefits.

One example of mid-journey AI is the **(AI image generator**, which uses machine learning algorithms to create new images based on a set of inputs. While the technology is able to generate new images, they may not be of the same quality or realism as images created by human designers. Additionally, the technology may not have been fully integrated into the relevant industry or field, and its use may be limited to specific tasks or applications.

Mid-journey AI can also refer to the stage in which an organization or individual has started to implement AI technology, but is still in the process of fully understanding its capabilities and limitations. The organization may not have fully integrated AI into their operations and may still be in the process of testing and evaluating the technology.




# How to generate images?
Currently the only way to generate images is from its **discord server** (do note that it’s a beta server , changes are constantly being made). Make an account if you haven’t already and join with link provided.

- Now head over to any **newcomer rooms**

- Now type the image you want to be generated. For this example, we will create a AI image of Harry potter and the flash’s Barry Allen (with the addition of a 4k image and realistic lighting). The more you specify the better the results, but input the command as shown below.

-  Let the bot do its work and your image will be generated in the meanwhile.

-  Each image created will show four variations

-  The images can be either up-scaled or variations can be made again. But in this I will upscale version three.

### **The final Result:**

# Wrap up

There we go, quite the image generated so far.... **but** this is just the beginning. Just imagine the possible development that it can achieve such as:

- Improved image quality: AI image generators will continue to improve in terms of image quality, realism, and diversity. This will be achieved by using more advanced deep learning techniques and larger and more diverse training datasets.

- Greater integration with other technologies: AI image generators will increasingly be integrated with other technologies such as virtual and augmented reality, allowing for the creation of more immersive and interactive experiences.

- Automation and scalability: AI image generators will become more automated and scalable, making them easier to use and accessible to a wider range of users. This will enable more efficient and cost-effective image generation.

- **Ethical concerns: As AI image generators become more advanced, there will be increasing ethical concerns about their use, particularly when it comes to creating images of people. Efforts will be made to ensure that the technology is used responsibly and in compliance with privacy and data protection regulations.**

- Cloud-based solutions: More AI image generators will be cloud-based solutions, which will allow for easy access and scalability, and can also help to lower the cost of ownership.

Overall, the future of mid-journey AI image generators looks promising, with the potential to revolutionise various industries with more realistic and diverse images, greater integration with other technologies, more automation, scalability and ethical concerns.
