Having recently graduated from Kingston University, I earned a first-class honours degree in Cyber Security and Computer Forensics. Fuelled by a longstanding passion for IT and technology, I am actively seeking new career opportunities to apply my expertise. My journey into the world of cybersecurity began during my college years, sparking an enduring interest that inspired me to specialise in this field.

In addition to my academic pursuits, I relish creating content for YouTube, honing my video editing techniques, and skilfully utilising Photoshop.

- I'm a **Potterhead** and a huge fan of Harry Potter.
