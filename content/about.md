A recent graduate from Kingston University, where I received a first-class degree with honours in Cyber Security and Computer Forensics. I am currently job-seeking for new opportunities. I was first exposed to cybersecurity during college, which intrigued me to pursue it further.

- I enjoy creating content on youtube, editing and using photoshop.

- I'm a **Potterhead** and a huge fan of Harry Potter.
