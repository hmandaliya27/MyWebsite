# Introduction
The project centres on Fly-by-Wire (FBW) technology, a system that supersedes traditional manual cockpit displays with a modern electronic interface. We developed a new cockpit display that not only incorporates FBW but also integrates several other essential aircraft control commands. This innovative interface is crafted to replace the standard manual flight controls found in conventional aircraft, whilst also offering additional control functionalities. The software for this interface was developed using Microsoft Visual Studio, specifically as a Windows Form Application.

> A graphical user interface was designed to represent the cockpit display, effectively showcasing the key features and functionalities of the aircraft during flight.
